  <Fragment slot="title">About — Cody Tanksley</Fragment>

  <section class="about">
    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      I’m <strong>Cody Tanksley</strong> — a software engineer in the Albany, NY area with a
      master’s in physics who loves building clear, reliable systems and writing about the
      practical side of making things.
    </p>
    <p>
      By day I ship backend services and integrations; by night I’m usually iterating on a
      project: photography, aquariums (Walstad methods, planted tanks), mechanical keyboards
      (ZMK, split layouts), 3D printing functional parts, or fountain‑pen tinkering. I try to
      keep my work and hobbies grounded in good craft, thoughtful constraints, and ethical
      consumption.
    </p>

    <h2>What I write about here</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Engineering notes: Java/Spring, build pipelines, auth, and integration gotchas.</li>
      <li>Making things: CAD/prints, custom keyboards, fixes that actually stick.</li>
      <li>Photography: learning in public, small‑moments storytelling.</li>
      <li>Aquariums: low‑tech planted setups, observations over time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clarity over cleverness.</strong> Simple, legible solutions age better.</li>
      <li><strong>Intentional minimalism.</strong> A few good tools used well.</li>
      <li><strong>Care.</strong> For people, animals, and the things we make and maintain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Around the site</h2>
    <p>
      This site is built with Astro and vanilla CSS. It supports light/dark/auto themes and keeps
      navigation fast and accessible. I’m slowly collecting notes into longer essays; posts might
      start as field logs and get refined over time.
    </p>

    <h2>Elsewhere</h2>
    <p>
      I’m gradually rebuilding my online presence under <em>tanksc.com</em>. If you want to get in
      touch, the easiest path is a quick email: <a href="mailto:hello@tanksc.com">hello@tanksc.com</a>.
